// PAYMENT "SCREENS" DTOs  (frontend payment.json spec — api/v1/*)
//
// These map 1:1 to the shapes the frontend designed in payment.json. They are
// intentionally separate from the existing PaymentDtos so the screen contract can
// evolve without disturbing the current PaymentController DTOs.
//
// CONVENTIONS:
//  - PascalCase C# properties serialize to camelCase JSON (MvcJsonDefaults.Web),
//    which is exactly what the frontend expects (monthLabel, studentId, ...).
//  - Entity ids are exposed as STRINGS per the frontend contract (backend uses long).
//  - DateTimes are returned as-is (System.Text.Json emits ISO-8601).
