/// CONTRACT: call this AFTER the owning transaction commits, wrapped in try/catch by the caller —
/// a notification failure must never roll back or fail the parent's request. The implementation
/// owns its own SaveChanges for the inbox row (post-commit side-effect unit).
///
/// The implementation lives in the INFRASTRUCTURE layer (CLAUDE.md §6.2 — notification fan-out is
/// an infrastructure concern and must never drag Hangfire or transport types into Application).
///
/// BATCHING is the caller's decision, not this interface's: the service reads the newest pending
/// request's timestamp BEFORE inserting and only calls this when the teacher has not already been
/// notified within the last hour, so a burst of requests produces one notification.
