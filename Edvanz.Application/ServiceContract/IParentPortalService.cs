/// approved grant on that student. A parent therefore keeps access across browsers and handsets —
/// and revocation has to be phone-wide to mean anything (see <c>ITeacherParentPortalService</c>).
///
/// A roster id supplied on the route is NEVER trusted — it is only compared against the grant,

/// eligible → roster row still exists → grant still Active → the module's own parent-visibility
/// flag. Nothing is cached in the grant row, so a teacher revoking a section or switching the
/// portal off takes effect on the very next request.
