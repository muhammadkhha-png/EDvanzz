/// <summary>
/// Configuration for the nightly auto-absent sweep (AutoAbsentJob / AttendanceAutoAbsentService).
/// Bound from the appsettings.json section "AutoAbsent" so behaviour can be tuned WITHOUT a code
/// change — locally via appsettings.json, on Azure App Service via application settings
/// "AutoAbsent__Enabled" / "AutoAbsent__EffectiveFrom" etc. (a save restarts the app; no redeploy,
/// no DDL). Defaults below apply when the section (or a key) is absent.
///
/// WHY EACH KNOB EXISTS:
/// - <see cref="Enabled"/> is the kill switch — flip it off to stop the sweep instantly in an
///   incident without an unschedule/redeploy.
/// - <see cref="EffectiveFrom"/> makes the feature NON-retroactive: the sweep NEVER marks absences
///   for class days before this date. On first deploy this prevents a mass back-write of every
///   unmarked historical occurrence. Set it to the go-live date.
/// - <see cref="LookbackDays"/> bounds the rolling catch-up window (from each teacher's local today
///   backwards) so a multi-day outage still fills in the missed days, while the query stays cheap.
///   Never marks older than <see cref="EffectiveFrom"/> regardless of this window.
