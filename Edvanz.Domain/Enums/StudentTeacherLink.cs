/// REQUEST/APPROVAL FLOW (supersedes the original AAM-FR-05.5 credential flow):
/// the student sends a request carrying the teacher's 8-digit TeacherCode plus a
/// self-typed name (and optionally the student code the teacher assigned them).
/// The row is created with LinkStatus.Pending and TeacherStudentId = null.
/// The teacher then accepts it — binding it to one of their TeacherStudent roster
/// records and setting LinkStatus.Active — or rejects it (LinkStatus.Rejected).
///
/// AAM-FR-05.6: Upon acceptance, the teacher appears on the student's dashboard.
/// AAM-FR-05.7: A student can link to multiple teachers; each is displayed distinctly.
/// AAM-BR-06: Each teacher's visibility settings apply independently.
/// AAM-FR-05.8: Content visibility is governed by TeacherConfiguration (AAM-FR-04.8).
///

///   StudentUser → StudentTeacherLink → Teacher → TeacherConfiguration (visibility)
///   StudentUser → StudentTeacherLink → TeacherStudent (attendance, payments, grades)
///
/// Terminal rows (Rejected/Unlinked/RemovedByTeacher/CancelledByStudent) are kept
/// for audit; a filtered unique index allows at most one live (Pending/Active) row
