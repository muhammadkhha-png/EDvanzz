/// <summary>
/// One parent-portal GRANT: permission for a single browser/device to follow ONE
/// <see cref="TeacherStudent"/> roster record under ONE teacher, read-only, from the public
/// portal at parent.edvanz.io (a PHP page that calls this API server-to-server).
///
/// The parent identifies the student by typing the teacher's public 8-digit code plus the
/// teacher's per-roster student code (and, optionally, their phone). Because
/// <see cref="TeacherStudent.StudentCode"/> is a SEQUENTIAL counter (A1, A2 … Z999) and
/// <see cref="Teacher.TeacherCode"/> is public, the codes alone are NOT a credential — access
/// is always a grant the teacher approves.
///
/// THE UNIT OF TRUST IS THE PHONE, NOT THE ROW. A row is per (student, device), but a grant is
/// created Active whenever the typed phone is already trusted for that student — either it
/// matches the roster's parent phone (<see cref="AutoApproved"/>) or it already holds an Active
/// grant a teacher vetted (<see cref="ParentPortalAccessOrigin.TrustedPhone"/>). So clearing
/// cookies, switching browser or buying a new phone does NOT push an approved parent back into
/// the inbox. The corollary is load-bearing: REVOKING must clear every live row sharing that
/// (student, phone), or the parent walks straight back in through a surviving sibling row.
///
/// TENANT INTEGRITY: <see cref="TeacherId"/> is denormalized from the roster record and
/// participates in the composite FK <c>(TeacherStudentId, TeacherId)</c> →
/// <c>TeacherStudents(Id, TeacherId)</c> (CLAUDE.md §4.4, VideoScope is the reference
/// implementation), so a row whose teacher does not match its student's teacher cannot exist.
///
/// PRIVACY: the portal's raw device id is NEVER stored — only <see cref="DeviceHash"/>, its
/// SHA-256 hex. Same for the caller IP (<see cref="RequestIpHash"/>).
