// ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// STUDENT / PARENT PAYMENT TRACKING SCREEN DTOs
//
// One screen = one call. GetStudentPaymentTrackingAsync returns the whole screen:
// a header, the single Upcoming month, the Paid section, and the Overdue section.
// Gated by TeacherConfiguration.StudentVisibilityPayment / ParentVisibilityPayment.
//
// FRONTEND MAPPING CONTRACT:
// - Every money value is named EXPLICITLY (AmountDue / AmountPaid / OutstandingAmount)
//   so a field never has to be interpreted by which section it sits in:
//     • Paid card     → render AmountPaid   (prefix "+")
//     • Overdue card  → render OutstandingAmount (prefix "-")
//     • Upcoming card → render AmountDue     (prefix "+")
// - All three sections use the SAME row shape (StudentPaymentPeriodDto) so the client
//   can bind one "period card" component everywhere.
// - Amounts are POSITIVE magnitudes; the sign is a presentation concern of the section.
