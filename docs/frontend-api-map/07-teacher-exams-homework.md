# 07 — Teacher: Exams & Homework

Source: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/**` (~84 files) covers BOTH **offline/paper exams**
(`api/exams/*`) and **online exams** (`api/online-exams/*`); `lib/feature/teacher_module/homework/**`
(~12 files) is a separate feature folder that visually clones the online-exam screens but is **not wired
to any backend** — see the dedicated section at the end. Endpoint constants:
`lib/core/network_services/web_constant.dart` — `webPathExams*` (lines ~170–181),
`webPathOnlineExam*` (~184–216), `webPathTeacherSubjects` (~185), `webPathUpload` (~505).

Data flow (offline exams): `TeacherExamRemoteDataSource` (Dio) → `TeacherExamRepositoryImpl` → cubits →
views, all through the standard envelope `{success, code, message, data}`.
Data flow (online exams): `TeacherOnlineExamRemoteDataSource` → `TeacherOnlineExamRepositoryImpl` →
cubits → views. Responses on this side are parsed **defensively** (comment in the DTO file: "response
schemas undocumented") — most fields are read via 2–3 alternate key names (`json['x'] ?? json['y']`).
Only the request shapes below (built by the app itself) are exact; response field names marked "or" are
the app's own defensive fallbacks, not confirmed alternates from the server.

Two concurrency-token conventions coexist in this chapter:
- **Offline exams** — a per-row **`rowVersion`** (opaque string) on every `ExamStudentRowApiDto`. Grade
  and attendance batch saves echo the token back per item so a retry never reuses a stale one.
- **Online exams** — a single **`rowVersion`** on the exam itself (`List<int>` on the wire, but the app
  round-trips it as `String.fromCharCodes(...)` when sending it back — treat it as an opaque blob, never
  parse it). Every status PATCH returns a **fresh** `rowVersion`; the app always chains the latest one
  into the next status call.

Dates: the offline-exam `examDate` (SeparateTime) and `GET session-dates` `date` are calendar dates,
sent/received as `"yyyy-MM-dd"` with no time component. Online-exam `startDateTime`/`endDateTime` are
full UTC instants (`toUtc().toIso8601String()`, i.e. `...Z`).

---

## Offline Exams Home
_Dart file: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/teacher_exam_home_view.dart`_
_Cubit: `TeacherExamHomeCubit`_
**Reached from:** teacher side-menu drawer → "Activity" (expandable) → "Offline Exams".

Two independent paginated lists (Upcoming / Past) on one screen; each has its own page cursor and
"load more" on near-bottom scroll. There is no status/date filter sheet on this screen (a
`TeacherOfflineExamFilterSheet` widget exists in the codebase but is never invoked from anywhere — dead
UI). Cards are the backend's one-row-per-exam-per-session rows, **grouped client-side** into one card
per exam (`groupExamHomeCards`) — stats are summed across the exam's session rows.

| UI element / action | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Screen load / pull-to-refresh | `GET api/exams/home` | Query `upcomingPage=1`, `pastPage=1`, `pageSize=10` (clamped 1–10) | `upcoming`/`past`, each `{data:[...], page, pageSize, totalCount, totalPages}` (older bare-array shape also tolerated). Row: `examId`, `occurrenceId`, `name`, `deliveryType` (`"DuringSession"`\|`"SeparateTime"`), `sessionId`, `sessionName`, `date`, `assignedCount`, `totalStudents`, `attendedCount`, `missedCount`, `pendingCount`, `isPast`, `assignedSessions[]` (length only, used as the exam's total session count) |
| Scroll near bottom | same, next page | `upcomingPage`/`pastPage` advanced independently | appends to the relevant list |
| FAB "+" | *(navigation only)* | — | opens **Create / Edit Offline Exam** below |
| Card tap | *(navigation only)* | — | opens **Offline Exam Detail** below |
| Card ⋮ → Edit | *(navigation only)* | — | opens **Create / Edit Offline Exam** in edit mode |
| Card ⋮ → Delete | `DELETE api/exams/{examId}` | Query `confirm=true` (comment: "DeletionConfirmationRequired unless confirm=true" — the app always sends it, so the confirm-required variant of the error is never actually surfaced) | 200 → row removed (optimistic — removed from state before the call, restored on failure) + success toast |

## Create / Edit Offline Exam
_Dart file: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/teacher_offline_exam_create_view.dart`_
_Cubit: `TeacherOfflineExamCreateCubit`_
**Reached from:** Offline Exams Home → FAB "+" (create) or card ⋮ → Edit.

Recipients are **sessions XOR groups** (radio-like: picking one clears the other, with a confirm dialog
if the opposite already has a selection) via the shared **Target Scope Picker** (below). Delivery type
is **DuringSession** (per-session/-group-member a specific already-scheduled class occurrence must be
picked) or **SeparateTime** (one exam date for the whole recipient set). Editing an exam pre-loads via
`GET api/exams/{examId}` and always resolves `recipientType: sessions` (an edited exam's original
groups-vs-sessions distinction is not reconstructed — `sessionIds` sent on save are simply every session
in the loaded detail; the resolved student audience is identical, but the exam's scope rows change from
`SessionGroup` to `Session`, so its home-card `selectionMode` flips to "Sessions").

**`notes` round-trips as of 2026-09-13.** `GET api/exams/{examId}` now returns `notes`, the edit form
hydrates it, and the app sends it on EVERY save including as an empty string. Server-side an **omitted**
`notes` means "leave it alone" and an **empty string** means "clear it" — before this, the GET did not
return it, so the form opened blank and a structural save wrote the blank over the teacher's text. Do not
reintroduce an unconditional `template.Notes = …` on the update path (CLAUDE.md BUG-20).

| UI element / action | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Groups / Sessions tile | *(navigation only)* | — | opens Target Scope Picker; result list feeds `applyGroupSelection`/`applySessionSelection` |
| Calendar icon on a session/group row (DuringSession) | `GET api/exams/session-dates` (one call per underlying session; for a group, unioned across its member sessions) | Query `sessionId`, `year`, `month` (calendar month currently shown in the date-picker dialog) | `[{sessionOccurrenceId, date, status}]` — only presence of a date in this list makes that calendar day tappable; `status` is not otherwise read by the picker |
| Date-picker "Continue" | *(local state only)* | — | stores `{sessionId → sessionOccurrenceId, sessionId → date}` per session (never fans out to sibling sessions) |
| Exam date field (SeparateTime) | *(local state only)* | — | plain date picker, no API |
| "Create" / "Save" | `POST api/exams` (create) or `PUT api/exams/{examId}` (edit) | see JSON below | `examId` (create) used to navigate to the success screen; edit treats envelope success as sufficient even if `data` is null/partial (PUT may return an incomplete body) |

Create/update request body (`CreateExamRequestApiDto.toJson`) — **SeparateTime + sessions**:
```json
{
  "name": "Midterm - Algebra",
  "notes": "Bring calculators",
  "deliveryType": "SeparateTime",
  "maxGrade": 100,
  "successScore": 50,
  "sessionIds": [228, 229],
  "examDate": "2026-09-20"
}
```
- `notes` omitted entirely when blank.
- `examDate` is date-only (`yyyy-MM-dd`) — **never** sent together with `sessionOccurrences`.
- `sessionIds` XOR `groupIds`: only whichever recipient type is active is included (empty/absent
  otherwise).

**DuringSession + groups** — every resolved MEMBER session of the selected group(s) gets its own picked
occurrence, per CLAUDE.md §7.5 ("during-session dates are per session"):
```json
{
  "name": "Pop quiz - Chapter 3",
  "deliveryType": "DuringSession",
  "maxGrade": 20,
  "successScore": 10,
  "groupIds": [14],
  "sessionOccurrences": [
    { "sessionId": 228, "sessionOccurrenceId": 5231 },
    { "sessionId": 231, "sessionOccurrenceId": 5390 }
  ]
}
```
- `sessionOccurrences[]` entries must cover the resolved session set exactly (one pick per session,
  including group members) — this is enforced client-side before submit (`canSubmit` requires every
  resolved session id to have an occurrence picked).
- A picked occurrence may be in the past (edit mode allows browsing past calendar months).

**Errors:** the app does not special-case any offline-exam create/update error code (no `switch` on
`code` for this endpoint) — any failure just surfaces the server's localized `message` as a toast. A
structural-edit conflict on an exam that already has results (documented backend-side as
`ExamHasResultsCannotRestructure`, CLAUDE.md §7.5) would therefore render as a generic error banner, not
a dedicated message.

## Target Scope Picker (shared)
_Dart file: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/teacher_exam_target_scope_view.dart`_
_Cubit: `TeacherExamTargetScopeCubit`_
**Reached from:** Create/Edit Offline Exam and Create/Edit Online Exam recipient tiles ("Groups" /
"Sessions"). Also usable in a `students` mode, but neither exam create flow opens it that way (both
call `_openTargetScope` only with `groups`/`sessions`).

This screen has **no exam-specific endpoint of its own** — it reuses the Sessions/Groups/Students list
endpoints documented in the Sessions and Students chapters:

| UI element / action | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Groups mode, screen load | Session-groups list endpoint (`TeacherSessionRepository.fetchGroups`) | `teacherId` (resolved from the stored session, never from a route param) | `id`, `groupName`, `sessionCount`, `studentCount` per row |
| Sessions mode, screen load / search (350ms debounce) / infinite scroll | Session list endpoint (`TeacherSessionRepository.fetchSessions`) | `page`, `pageSize=10`, `activeOnly=true`, `search` | `id`, `sessionName`, `studentCount`, `sessionGroupName` per row |
| Students mode (unused by either exam flow today) | Student list endpoint (`TeacherStudentRepository.fetchStudents`) | `page`, `pageSize=10`, `search` | `id`, `studentName`, `studentCode` per row |
| "Continue" | *(local only)* | — | pops the selected `TeacherExamTargetScopeItem[]` back to the caller |

## Offline Exam Detail (session list)
_Dart file: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/teacher_offline_exam_detail_view.dart`_
_Cubit: `TeacherOfflineExamDetailCubit`_
**Reached from:** Offline Exams Home → card tap.

| UI element / action | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Screen load / pull-to-refresh | `GET api/exams/{examId}` | — | `examId`, `name`, `deliveryType`, `maxGrade`, `successScore`, `distinctStudentCount`, `globalStats` (`totalStudents`, `gradedCount`, `average`, `highest`, `lowest`, `attendedCount`, `missedCount`, `pendingCount`, `belowPassingCount` — rendered in the exam-level stats grid), `sessions[]` (`sessionId`, `sessionName`, `occurrenceId`, `date`, `stats`, `attendanceTaken`, `gradesTaken`) |
| Search box (client-side filter over the already-loaded session list) | — | — | — |
| Session card tap | *(navigation only, passes the already-loaded session block so the next screen skips a re-fetch)* | — | opens **Session Roster & Actions** below |

## Session Roster & Actions
_Dart file: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/teacher_offline_exam_session_view.dart`_
_Cubit: `TeacherOfflineExamSessionCubit`_
_Actions sheet: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/widgets/teacher_offline_exam_session_actions_bottom_sheet.dart`_
**Reached from:** Offline Exam Detail → a session row.

| UI element / action | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Screen load (no seeded session/meta, or forced refresh) | `GET api/exams/{examId}` | — | resolves this session's block from `sessions[]`, then falls through to the roster call below |
| Roster load / search (350ms debounce) / infinite scroll | `GET api/exams/{examId}/sessions/{sessionId}` | Query `page`, `pageSize=30`, `search` (no `graded` filter on this screen) | `examId`, `sessionId`, `sessionName`, `occurrenceId`, `date`, `maxGrade`, `successScore`, `students` page (`data[]`/`page`/`pageSize`/`totalCount`/`totalPages` — a bare array is also tolerated). Per student: `obligationId`, `teacherStudentId`, `studentName`, `studentCode`, `status` (`Pending`\|`Attended`\|`AttendedWithGrade`\|`DidNotAttend`), `attended`, `grade`, `isGradeEntered`, `isBelowPassing`, `rowVersion` |
| ⋮ menu → "Take attendance" / "Edit attendance" | *(navigation only)* — opens the shared class-attendance screen, `AppRoute.goToTeacherTakeAttendance` | Passes `examId` **only when the exam is SeparateTime** (that screen then writes through `api/exams/attendance*`, see below); for a **DuringSession** exam, `examId` is omitted and `occurrenceDate` is passed instead — attendance for that class day is taken through the **ordinary class-attendance endpoints** (documented in the Attendance chapter), because the exam's own attendance state there is just a reflection of the class register, not a separate write path | screen pop → session refreshed |
| ⋮ menu → "Add grades" / "Edit grades" | *(navigation only)* | — | opens **Grades Entry** below |

## Grades Entry
_Dart file: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/teacher_offline_exam_grades_view.dart`_
_Cubit: `TeacherOfflineExamGradesCubit`_
**Reached from:** Session Roster ⋮ menu → "Add grades"/"Edit grades".

| UI element / action | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Screen load | `GET api/exams/{examId}` then `GET api/exams/{examId}/sessions/{sessionId}` | roster query `page=1`, `pageSize=30`, `graded` per the active chip | same roster shape as above; per-row `rowVersion` is cached and echoed back on save |
| Search box / All-Graded-Not graded chips | re-fetch page 1 | `graded`: chip "All" → omitted, "Graded" → `true`, "Not graded" → `false` (**server-side** filter — the roster pages 30 at a time, so a client-side filter would hide rows past page 1) | — |
| Typing a grade box, "Next" on keyboard | *(local draft only)* | — | walks focus to the next gradable row |
| "Submit (N) students" | `PUT api/exams/grades` | see JSON below | see batch result shape below |
| Failed-rows banner → "Try again" | re-fetches every already-loaded page (to get fresh `rowVersion`s) then re-submits only the still-failed rows | same shape as Submit | same |
| A blocked row's "Fix attendance" link | *(navigation only, same shared attendance screen as above)* | — | `refreshAfterAttendanceChange()` re-pulls the roster afterward |

Request (`BatchGradeRequestApiDto`) — clearing a grade is `grade: null`, only sent after a confirm
dialog naming the affected student(s):
```json
{
  "examId": 501,
  "items": [
    { "teacherStudentId": 3312, "grade": 85, "rowVersion": "AAAAAAAAB9E=" },
    { "teacherStudentId": 3313, "grade": null, "rowVersion": "AAAAAAAAB9F=" }
  ]
}
```
`rowVersion` is copied verbatim from the roster row the app just loaded — never parsed or constructed
client-side.

Response (`BatchGradeResultApiDto`):
```json
{
  "updatedCount": 1,
  "allSucceeded": false,
  "items": [
    { "obligationId": 9001, "teacherStudentId": 3312, "success": true, "status": "AttendedWithGrade", "grade": 85, "rowVersion": "AAAAAAAAB9G=" },
    { "obligationId": 9002, "teacherStudentId": 3313, "success": false, "code": "ObligationConcurrencyConflict", "status": "DidNotAttend", "rowVersion": "AAAAAAAAB9H=" }
  ]
}
```

**`code` values the app special-cases per row** (`_itemFailureMessage`):

| `code` | UI behavior |
|---|---|
| `ObligationConcurrencyConflict` | "This grade was changed elsewhere — reload and try again." The row's `rowVersion`/`status`/`grade` ARE still adopted from this response (the server's authoritative current view), so a bare retry (without a manual re-fetch) can succeed next time. |
| `CannotGradeAbsentStudent` | "This student was marked absent" — the grade box is disabled with this reason; "Fix attendance" link shown. |
| `AttendanceNotRecordedForExam` | "Attendance hasn't been recorded yet" — same disabled-box treatment. |
| `GradeExceedsMax` / `GradeOutOfRange` | Generic "grade exceeds the maximum" message (the app also validates this client-side before sending). |
| `ObligationNotFound` / `AmbiguousStudentInExam` / anything else | Generic "grade could not be saved." |

Only a `success` row or one carrying `ObligationConcurrencyConflict` is treated as reflecting the
server's current state (row `status`/`grade`/`rowVersion` adopted); every other failure code leaves the
row exactly as the teacher had it, so retry resends the same value.

## Take Attendance (SeparateTime exam) + QR Scan
_Cubit: `TeacherExamTakeAttendanceCubit`_ (extends the shared `TeacherTakeAttendanceCubit` used by the
plain class-attendance screen; selected automatically when `examId` is passed to
`AppRoute.goToTeacherTakeAttendance`)
**Reached from:** Session Roster ⋮ → "Take/Edit attendance", or the Grades screen's "Fix attendance"
link — both only for a **SeparateTime** exam.

| UI element / action | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Screen load / search / infinite scroll | `GET api/exams/{examId}/sessions/{sessionId}` | `page`, `pageSize=10`, `search` | roster rows mapped to Present/Absent/unmarked (`Pending`+`attended:false` = unmarked; `attended`/`AttendedWithGrade` = present; `DidNotAttend` = absent) |
| Manual code lookup (barcode fallback) | same roster call | `search = <code>` | exact case-insensitive `studentCode` match only (never `.first` on a fuzzy match) |
| Tap a student → mark Present/Absent | `PUT api/exams/attendance` | `{occurrenceId, items:[{teacherStudentId, present}]}` — **exam attendance is Present/Absent only**; a Held mark from the shared attendance UI is mapped to `present:false` | on success, roster reloaded |
| Bulk mark (multi-select) | same endpoint | `items[]` with one entry per selected student | same |
| QR scan | `POST api/exams/attendance/scan` | `{occurrenceId, code}` | `{obligationId, teacherStudentId, studentName, studentCode, status, alreadyProcessed}` — `alreadyProcessed:true` still returns success (idempotent re-scan) |

Request/response shapes:
```json
{ "occurrenceId": 5231, "items": [{ "teacherStudentId": 3312, "present": true }] }
```
```json
{ "updatedCount": 1, "allSucceeded": true, "items": [{ "obligationId": 9001, "success": true, "status": "Attended", "rowVersion": "AAAAAAAAB9I=" }] }
```

**`code` values the app special-cases** (`_examAttendanceItemCodeMessageKey`):

| `code` | UI behavior |
|---|---|
| `ObligationNotFound` | "Could not find this student's exam record." |
| `AttendanceReadOnlyForDuringSession` | "Attendance for this exam is read-only here" — defensive; the app never routes a DuringSession exam through this endpoint, so this should not normally fire. |
| `NotAnExam` / `AttendanceNotRecordedForExam` | Generic "attendance could not be saved." |
| anything else | Generic "attendance could not be saved." |

A whole-batch failure (`allSucceeded:false` and `updatedCount:0`) surfaces the first per-item message it
finds; a partial success (`updatedCount>0`) is treated as success and the roster is reloaded.

## Offline Exam Created (success)
_Dart file: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/teacher_offline_exam_success_view.dart`_
**Reached from:** Create Offline Exam → successful submit. No API of its own — "Go to Exam" replaces
the route with **Offline Exam Detail**.

---

## Online Exams Home
_Dart file: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/teacher_online_exam_home_view.dart`_
_Cubit: `TeacherOnlineExamHomeCubit`_
**Reached from:** teacher side-menu drawer → "Activity" → "Online Exams".

| UI element / action | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Screen load / pull-to-refresh / search (debounced) / infinite scroll / filter sheet (All/Published/Draft/Solved) | `GET api/online-exams` | Query **`Status`** (capitalized; `"Published"`\|`"Draft"`\|`"Closed"`, omitted for "All"), **`Search`**, **`Page`**, **`PageSize`** (all capitalized — different convention from the offline-exam home query) | Either a bare list or `{data:[...], page, pageSize, totalCount, totalPages}`. Per row: `id`/`onlineExamId`, `title`/`name`, `status`, `startDateTime`/`startAt`/`date`, `endDateTime`/`endAt`, `subject`/`subjectName`/`teacherSubjectName`, `questionCount`/`questionsCount`, `assignedCount`/`assignedStudentsCount`/`totalStudents`/`studentCount`, `unsolvedCount`, `solvedCount`, `blockedCount` |
| FAB "+" | *(navigation only)* | — | opens **Create/Edit Online Exam** below |
| Card tap, status = Draft | *(navigation only)* | — | opens **Online Exam Detail**; a `String` pop result (the deleted exam's id) removes that card locally instead of a full reload |
| Card tap, status = Published/Solved | *(navigation only)* | — | opens **Results — Groups/Scope Overview** (read-only, no list reload on return) |
| Card ⋮ → Edit | *(navigation only)* | — | opens **Create/Edit Online Exam** in edit mode |
| Card ⋮ → Delete | `DELETE api/online-exams/{id}` | — | row removed + success toast |
| Card "Add question" shortcut (draft cards with 0 questions) | *(navigation only)* | — | opens the standalone **Question Editor** |
| Card "Show results" shortcut | *(navigation only)* | — | opens **Results — Groups/Scope Overview** |

## Create / Edit Online Exam — Details step
_Dart file: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/teacher_online_exam_form_view.dart`_
_Cubit: `TeacherOnlineExamCreateCubit`_
**Reached from:** Online Exams Home FAB / card ⋮ → Edit; also reused verbatim by the Homework module
(see below) via `TeacherOnlineExamFormView(repository: <homework repo>, isHomeworkFlow: true)`.

Two-step wizard (`TeacherOnlineExamCreateStepper`): Details → Questions. Nothing is written to the
server on Details alone **except** that "Next" immediately calls create/update — i.e. a Draft row is
created on the server the moment the teacher first reaches the Questions step, even before any question
exists. Recipients are groups/sessions only here (no "students" mode).

| UI element / action | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Screen open, editing | `GET api/online-exams/{id}` then `GET api/online-exams/{id}/questions` | — | hydrates every field below; `questions[]` used only to recompute `examScore` (sum of `degree`) since the detail GET omits questions |
| Groups / Sessions tile | *(navigation only)* | — | Target Scope Picker (shared, see above) |
| Date / Start time / End time pickers | *(local only)* | — | duration is derived (`end - start`), never sent as a separate field beyond what the timestamps imply |
| "All questions have equal score" toggle + score field | *(local only)* | — | when off, exam score is computed later from the sum of each question's own score |
| "Block student if they leave..." toggle + violations stepper (1–5) | *(local only)* | — | `blockOnViolation`, `maxViolations` |
| "Publish exam" toggle | *(local only, applied later)* | — | create always posts `status:"Draft"` regardless of this toggle; publishing happens via a separate PATCH once questions are saved (see Details tab note below) |
| "Next" | `POST api/online-exams` (first time) or `PUT api/online-exams/{id}` (already has a server draft) | see JSON below | `id`/`onlineExamId`, `rowVersion`, `teacherSubjectId`, `visibility` — advances to the Questions step |
| Back / Cancel with unsaved local edits (no server draft yet) | *(local only)* | — | confirm dialog, no request |
| Back / Cancel with an existing server draft (create flow only) | "Discard draft" → `DELETE api/online-exams/{id}`; "Keep draft" → leaves it | — | draft removed or left as-is |

Create body (`onlineExamCreateBody`):
```json
{
  "teacherSubjectId": 4,
  "title": "Unit 2 Quiz",
  "description": "Covers chapters 4-6",
  "instructions": "Covers chapters 4-6",
  "startDateTime": "2026-09-20T08:00:00.000Z",
  "endDateTime": "2026-09-20T09:00:00.000Z",
  "passPercentage": 50,
  "visibility": true,
  "status": "Draft",
  "blockOnViolation": true,
  "maxViolations": 2,
  "scopes": [
    { "scopeType": "Session", "sessionId": 228, "sessionGroupId": null }
  ]
}
```
Notes:
- `instructions` is always a duplicate of `description` — the app has only one text box for both.
- `status` is **always** `"Draft"` on create; the app never creates an exam pre-published.
- `teacherSubjectId`: the app has **no subject picker UI** in this flow at all — it silently resolves to
  the first subject id in the teacher's cached profile (`LocalStorage.getTeacher()?.subjects`), falling
  back to `0` if none is cached. `GET api/Teacher/subjects` is never called from this screen (see
  "Endpoint coverage" for the dead-code detail).
- `scopeType` is `"Session"` or `"SessionGroup"`; the sibling id key is `null`.

Update body (`onlineExamUpdateBody`) — same `scopes` shape as create, built by the one shared
`onlineExamScopesJson` helper:
```json
{
  "teacherSubjectId": 4,
  "title": "Unit 2 Quiz",
  "description": "Covers chapters 4-6",
  "instructions": "Covers chapters 4-6",
  "startDateTime": "2026-09-20T08:00:00.000Z",
  "endDateTime": "2026-09-20T09:00:00.000Z",
  "passPercentage": 50,
  "visibility": true,
  "blockOnViolation": true,
  "maxViolations": 2,
  "scopes": [
    { "scopeType": "Session", "sessionId": 81, "sessionGroupId": null }
  ],
  "rowVersion": "AAAAAAAAB9I="
}
```
**Recipient-edit semantics (backend-visible contract):** the edit form is hydrated with the exam's
current recipients, so an untouched save sends the same set back and the server compares it as a set
and does nothing. `scopes` is **omitted** when the selection is somehow empty — absent means "leave
the recipients alone", which is the safe reading, since an empty list is refused
(`ScopeCannotBeEmpty`) and silently emptying an exam's audience would be worse than saving nothing.
Sessions and groups stay mutually exclusive in the form, so a mixed list (rejected as
`MixedScopeTypesNotAllowed`) is never sent. `teacherSubjectId` is still sent but has no property on
the server's update DTO and is **ignored** — the subject cannot be changed after create.

Server-side, a recipient change on an already-**Published** exam re-dispatches the publish
notification; the per-recipient idempotency index means only the newly-added students are told.
Note the whole update (recipients included) is refused with `ExamNotDraft` (409) once **any**
student has submitted.

## Create / Edit Online Exam — Questions step
_Widget: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/widgets/teacher_online_exam_questions_step_body.dart`_
_Cubit: `TeacherOnlineExamQuestionCubit` (`isStandaloneEditor: false`)_
**Reached from:** Details step → "Next".

A "quiz structure" section lets the teacher set a total question count and a MCQ/Multiple-answer split
before typing individual questions; each draft question is the same block used by the standalone editor
below (including the image-upload button).

| UI element / action | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Delete a question block (already-persisted question) | `PUT api/online-exams/{id}/questions` | `{questions: [...every remaining question, mapped from domain...]}` | — |
| "Create" / "Save changes" (finish wizard) | 1) `PATCH api/online-exams/{id}/status` `{status:"Draft"}` **only if currently Published** (so the questions PUT below is not rejected by `QuestionsEditableOnlyInDraft`), then 2) `PUT api/online-exams/{id}/questions` with **every** drafted question, then 3) if the Details step's "Publish exam" toggle is on and the exam is not already published, `PATCH api/online-exams/{id}/status` `{status:"Published", rowVersion}` | see bodies below | success → **Online Exam Success** screen (create) or pop with `didMutate:true` (edit) |

`PUT .../questions` body — full replace, not a diff:
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "questionText": "What is 2 + 2?",
      "questionType": "SingleChoice",
      "degree": 5,
      "imageFileId": "5f6e7a1b-...-uuid",
      "options": [
        { "optionText": "3", "isCorrect": false },
        { "optionText": "4", "isCorrect": true }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
- `imageFileId` key is **omitted entirely** when the question has no image (never sent as `null`).
- `questionType` on the wire is `"SingleChoice"` or `"MultipleChoice"` (note: **not** `"OneChoice"` —
  the app's own internal enum name `oneChoice` maps to the wire value `SingleChoice`).

Status PATCH body:
```json
{ "status": "Published", "rowVersion": "AAAAAAAAB9I=" }
```
`rowVersion` is omitted only when the app has none cached yet; every call's response `rowVersion` is
chained into the next one to avoid a stale-token conflict.

## Add / Edit Question (standalone editor)
_Dart file: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/teacher_online_exam_question_editor_view.dart`_
_Cubit: `TeacherOnlineExamQuestionCubit` (`isStandaloneEditor: true`)_
**Reached from:** Online Exam Detail → Questions tab → "+" / a question row; also Online Exams Home
card shortcut "Add question" for a 0-question draft.

| UI element / action | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Add photo" on a question | `POST api/upload` (multipart) | field `files` = one compressed JPEG (1080px/85%, or a picked file), field `category` = `"OnlineExamQuestionImage"` | `data[0]` = `{fileId, url, originalName, size, mimeType}` — `fileId` held as `imageFileId` on the draft, `url` used to preview it immediately |
| Remove photo | *(local only)* | — | clears `imageFileId`/`imageUrl` from the draft (the uploaded file itself is never explicitly deleted via `DELETE api/upload`) |
| "Submit" (new question) | `POST api/online-exams/{id}/questions` | one question body (see shape above, singular) | envelope success only — the response may be `data:true` or a question object; the app doesn't rely on the payload beyond envelope success |
| "Submit" (editing an existing question) | `PUT api/online-exams/{id}/questions` | **every** existing question with the edited one substituted in place (full replace) | — |
| Delete a question block (multi-question mode only) | `PUT api/online-exams/{id}/questions` | remaining questions, edited one removed | — |

## Online Exam Created (success)
_Dart file: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/teacher_online_exam_success_view.dart`_
**Reached from:** Questions step → finish wizard (create only). No API of its own — "Go to Exam" pops
back to Home with `didMutate:true` (so the list reloads) then pushes **Online Exam Detail**.

## Online Exam Detail
_Dart file: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/teacher_online_exam_detail_view.dart`_
_Cubit: `TeacherOnlineExamDetailCubit`_
**Reached from:** Online Exams Home → card tap (Draft exams only — Published/Solved go straight to
Results).

Three tabs: Information (read-only), Questions, Settings.

| UI element / action | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Screen load | `GET api/online-exams/{id}` then `GET api/online-exams/{id}/questions` | — | Information tab fields; question list feeds the Questions tab and re-derives `examScore`/`scorePerQuestion` |
| Questions tab → "+" / edit / delete a question | *(navigation to standalone editor, or)* `PUT api/online-exams/{id}/questions` (delete) | — | tab list refreshed; `markMutated()` sets the pop result to `true` |
| Settings tab → "Visibility" switch | `PATCH api/online-exams/{id}/status` | `{status: "Published"|"Draft", rowVersion}` | optimistic toggle, rolled back on failure |
| Settings tab → "Edit Exam information" | *(navigation only, questions ensured-loaded first so the edit form's score fields are correct)* | — | opens Details step in edit mode; a successful save pops the WHOLE detail screen (not just back to this tab) |
| Settings tab → "Edit or add questions" | *(local tab switch)* | — | jumps to Questions tab |
| Settings tab → "Delete Exam" | `DELETE api/online-exams/{id}` | — | pops with the deleted exam's id (`String`) so Home can remove the row without a full reload |

## Results — Groups/Scope Overview
_Dart file: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/teacher_online_exam_groups_results_view.dart`_
_Cubit: `TeacherOnlineExamResultsCubit`_
**Reached from:** Online Exams Home → card tap (Published/Solved), or card "Show results" shortcut.

| UI element / action | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Screen load / pull-to-refresh | `GET api/online-exams/{id}` (`withResults:true` → also calls `GET .../overview` then, if that has no per-student roster, `GET .../scope-analysis`) | — | aggregate stats (`averageGradesPercent`, `totalExams` = assigned count, `highestGrade`, `lowestGrade`, `passedCount`, `failedCount`, `blockedCount`, `missedCount` — counts are recomputed client-side from the roster when one is available, else taken from the aggregate as-is) + `scopes[]` → one card per session/group (`name`, `sessionsCount`/`studentsCount`) |
| Search / status filter (All/Passed/Failed) | *(client-side over the already-loaded roster)* | — | — |
| A scope card tap | *(navigation only)* | — | opens **Results — Student list**, narrowed to that scope's students (only when the roster rows actually carry a `sessionId`/`sessionGroupId` tag — otherwise every scope shows the full roster, since there's nothing to narrow by) |

## Results — Student list (one group/session)
_Dart file: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/teacher_online_exam_results_view.dart`_
_Cubit: `TeacherOnlineExamResultsCubit(groupId:, groupName:)`_
**Reached from:** Groups/Scope Overview → a scope card.

| UI element | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Screen load | same as above | — | same summary, `students[]` filtered to the passed `groupId` |
| Student row tap (any status except "not attended") | *(navigation only)* | — | opens **Student Answer Sheet**; a never-attempted student's row is inert (no answer sheet to show — the API would 404) |
| "Unblock" button (blocked students only) | `PATCH api/online-exams/{id}/students/{teacherStudentId}/status` | `{status: "InProgress"}` — `"InProgress"` is the app's chosen unblock transition; there is no separate "Active" value in the domain enum | success → full `load(force:true)` (never a local patch — the server recomputes the report) |
| "View question analysis" tile | *(navigation only)* | — | opens **Question Analysis** |

**Unblock error handling:** a 409 (a student who already submitted their attempt cannot be reopened) is
surfaced verbatim as the server's message — the button is simply never shown for a student whose status
isn't `Blocked`, so this should only occur on a race.

## Question Analysis
_Dart file: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/teacher_exam_analysis_view.dart`_
_Cubit: `TeacherExamAnalysisCubit`_
**Reached from:** Student list (Results) → "View question analysis".

| UI element | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Screen load / pull-to-refresh | `GET api/online-exams/{id}/question-analysis` | — | `finalizedAttempts` (shown as "Based on N finalized attempts"), `questions[]`: `questionId`, `questionText`, `degree`, `order`, `attemptedCount`, `correctCount`, `skippedCount`, `correctPercentage` (nullable — "nobody attempted it" is deliberately distinct from "0% correct"), `topWrongOptionText`, `topWrongOptionCount` |

No writes on this screen. A question with `correctPercentage == null` renders "Untouched" instead of a
0% badge.

## Student Answer Sheet
_Dart file: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/teacher_exam_answer_sheet_view.dart`_
_Cubit: `TeacherExamAnswerSheetCubit`_
**Reached from:** Results (student list) → a student row.

| UI element | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Screen load / pull-to-refresh | `GET api/online-exams/{id}/students/{teacherStudentId}/answers` | — | reuses the STUDENT-side review parser byte-for-byte (`StudentOnlineExamReviewApiDto`): `examId`, `examName`, `finalized`, `score`, `percentage`, `reportStatus`, `questions[]` (`questionId`, `questionText`, `questionType`, `degree`, `awardedDegree`, `imageUrl`, `options[]`: `id`/`optionId`, `optionText`/`label`/`text`, `isSelected`/`selected`, `isCorrect`/`correct`) |

`finalized:false` renders "Not finalized yet" instead of a score (an in-progress attempt's running total
is not shown as if it were a final grade).

## Homework — UI only, not wired to any backend
_Dart files: `lib/feature/teacher_module/homework/view/*.dart`_ (home, form, detail, question editor,
success) _+ `lib/feature/teacher_module/homework/data/teacher_homework_repository_impl.dart`_
**Reached from:** teacher side-menu drawer → "Activity" → "Homework" — but this entire menu row is
gated by `AppConfig.showHomework` (`= !AppConfig.isMvp`), and **`isMvp` is currently `true`**, so the
Homework menu entry is **not shown** in the current build at all.

Every homework screen is a thin wrapper reusing the online-exam views
(`TeacherHomeworkFormView` → `TeacherOnlineExamFormView`, `TeacherHomeworkDetailView` →
`TeacherOnlineExamDetailView`, `TeacherHomeworkQuestionEditorView` →
`TeacherOnlineExamQuestionEditorView`) but pointed at `TeacherHomeworkRepositoryImpl`, which is a
**pure in-memory mock store** (`List<TeacherOnlineExamDetail>` seeded from
`teacherHomeworkMockDetails()`, an incrementing local id counter) — registered as the real DI singleton
for `TeacherHomeworkRepository`, so this isn't a placeholder swapped out at build time; it's what ships.
**No HTTP call is made for any homework CRUD, publish, question, or results action** — create/update/
delete/publish/add-question/delete-question/results all just mutate the in-memory list and return
immediately. `fetchQuestionAnalysis` and `fetchStudentAnswerSheet` and `unblockStudent` explicitly return
a failure ("Homework analysis/answer sheets are not available" / "Homework students are never blocked"),
so the app never shows those entry points for homework.

**One real network call still fires despite this:** the question editor's "Add photo" button calls the
same shared `UploaderService`, so picking an image for a homework question really does
`POST api/upload` (category `OnlineExamQuestionImage` — homework has no category of its own) and gets a
real `fileId`/`url` back — it is simply attached to a question object that is never persisted anywhere
but local memory and is discarded when the app restarts. A backend developer inspecting upload traffic
may see `OnlineExamQuestionImage` uploads that never show up attached to any real exam; this is why.

Screen list (all present, none call a homework-specific endpoint):
- **Homework Home** (`teacher_homework_home_view.dart`, `TeacherHomeworkHomeCubit`) — clones the Online
  Exams Home layout (Published/Draft/Past sections, filter sheet, FAB).
- **Create/Edit Homework** (`teacher_homework_form_view.dart`) — wraps `TeacherOnlineExamFormView`.
- **Homework Detail** (`teacher_homework_detail_view.dart`) — wraps `TeacherOnlineExamDetailView`.
- **Add/Edit Homework Question** (`teacher_homework_question_editor_view.dart`) — wraps
  `TeacherOnlineExamQuestionEditorView`.
- **Homework Created (success)** (`teacher_homework_success_view.dart`) — same success-screen pattern,
  navigation only.

fileId → attach" for the general contract)

**Defined but never called from this chapter's code:**
- `webPathOnlineExamQuestionsBulk` → `POST api/online-exams/{id}/questions/bulk`. A wrapper method
  (`bulkCreateQuestions`) exists on `TeacherOnlineExamRemoteDataSource`, but nothing in the repository or
  any cubit calls it — question creation always goes through the single-question POST or the full-replace
  PUT.
- `webPathOnlineExamQuestionsOverview` → `GET api/online-exams/{id}/questions/overview`. The constant
  exists with no wrapper method and no caller anywhere in the app.
- `webPathTeacherSubjects` → `GET api/Teacher/subjects`. The exams module's own
  `TeacherOnlineExamRemoteDataSource.fetchSubjects()`/`TeacherOnlineExamRepositoryImpl.fetchSubjects()`
  implement this end-to-end but are **never invoked** by any exams-module cubit or view — the create form
  silently resolves `teacherSubjectId` from the cached teacher profile instead (see the Create/Edit
  Details-step note above). The same URL constant IS called live, but from the unrelated Auth module
  (`lib/feature/auth/data/auth_remote_data_source.dart`, subject selection during signup) — out of scope
  for this chapter.

## Offline exam paper (attachments) — added 2026-09-13

_Dart files: `lib/feature/teacher_module/exams/view/widgets/teacher_exam_paper_section.dart`
(detail screen) and `..._upload_card.dart` (create form); shared picker
`lib/core/services/attachments/attachment_picker.dart`._
**Reached from:** Offline Exam Detail → "Exam paper" section (between the stats grid and the
session search), and the create form after "Success score".

The teacher uploads the questions (PDF or photos) so students can review them afterwards.

| UI element / action | Endpoint | Sends | Uses from response |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Add file" | `POST api/upload` | multipart `files` + `category=ExamAttachment`; oversized PDFs are rasterised to fit and oversized photos re-encoded, both client-side | `fileId` |
| …then, on the detail screen | `POST api/exams/{examId}/attachments` | `{"fileIds": ["<guid>"]}` | `data[]` of `{id, fileName, contentType, fileSizeBytes, readUrl, createdAt}` — the exam's full list |
| …or, on the create form | `POST api/exams` | `attachmentFileIds: ["<guid>"]` alongside the normal create body (omitted when empty) | `examId` |
| Trash on a file row | `DELETE api/exams/{examId}/attachments/{fileId}` | — | the remaining list, same shape |
| "Students can see it" switch | `PUT api/exams/{examId}/attachments/release` | `{"override": true \| false \| null}` | `{releaseAt, override, visibleToStudents, releaseDelayHours, sessionsYetToSit[]}` |
| Tapping a file row | `GET api/files/{fileId}/url` | — | `data` = a short-lived signed URL, handed to the device viewer |
| Exam home card | `GET api/exams/home` | — | `attachmentsCount` per row (paper-clip chip; absent chip = none uploaded) |
| Exam detail load | `GET api/exams/{examId}` | — | `attachments[]` + `attachmentRelease{…}` |

**`override` is tri-state and `null` is a real value**, not "unchanged": it hands control back to the
automatic schedule. Do not treat it like the nullable "omitted = unchanged" fields elsewhere in this API.

**Release rule.** `releaseAt` = the LAST class to sit the exam (max occurrence date, teacher-local
midnight after it) **+ the teacher's `examAttachmentReleaseDelayHours`** (default 48, set in Settings →
Exams). Keyed on the last class, never the student's own: a DuringSession exam anchors each session to
its own class occurrence, so a per-student gate would hand Monday's class a paper Wednesday's class has
not sat yet. `visibleToStudents = override ?? (now >= releaseAt)` — computed, never stored, so the switch
turns itself on with no job to run. Rescheduling a class moves `releaseAt` on its own.

**`GET api/files/{fileId}/url` is not optional plumbing.** `/api/files/{id}` is `[Authorize]`, and
`launchUrl` sends no bearer — opening it directly answers **401**, which is why every PDF "download" in
the app silently did nothing. Resolve to the signed URL first, then hand THAT to the viewer. Never let the
HTTP client follow the gated endpoint's 302: that forwards the JWT to the storage host.
